# AI Smart Contract Solution

This project implements an AI smart contract solution that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The main components of the project include smart contracts written in Solidity, an AI model implemented in Python, and scripts for deployment and interaction with the smart contracts.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - **contracts/**: Contains the smart contracts.
    - **AIContract.sol**: The main AI smart contract.
    - **interfaces/**: Contains the interfaces for the smart contracts.
      - **IAIOracle.sol**: Interface for the AI Oracle contract.
  - **ai/**: Contains the AI model and inference code.
    - **model.py**: Implementation of the AI model.
    - **inference.py**: Handles inference for the AI model.
  - **scripts/**: Contains scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.
    - **deploy.js**: Script to deploy the AI smart contract.
    - **interact.js**: Script to interact with the deployed AI smart contract.
  - **tests/**: Contains test files for the smart contracts and integration tests.
    - **AIContract.test.js**: Unit tests for the AI smart contract.
    - **integration.test.js**: Integration tests for the AI model and smart contract.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-smart-contract
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Deploy the smart contract**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```
   node src/scripts/deploy.js
   ```

5. **Interact with the smart contract**:
   Use the interaction script to call contract methods:
   ```
   node src/scripts/interact.js
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure that you have the necessary environment set up for both Python and Node.js.
- Modify the smart contract and AI model as needed to fit your specific use case.
- Run tests to verify the functionality of the smart contracts and the integration with the AI model.
