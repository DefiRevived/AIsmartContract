# AI Smart Contract Project - Handoff Package

## 🚀 Welcome to the AI Smart Contract System

This package contains a complete AI-powered smart contract system that enables blockchain applications to request AI model predictions through an oracle mechanism. The system has been successfully deployed and tested on BSC Testnet.

## 📦 What's Included

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **`contracts/AIContract.sol`** - Main contract for AI prediction requests
- **`contracts/AIOracle.sol`** - Oracle contract that fulfills AI predictions
- **`contracts/interfaces/IAIOracle.sol`** - Interface definitions
- **`contracts/Migrations.sol`** - Truffle migration support

### AI Model & Oracle System (Python)
- **`src/ai/model.py`** - AI model wrapper and management
- **`src/ai/inference.py`** - AI inference engine
- **`src/ai/oracle_bridge.py`** - Oracle bridge for blockchain interaction
- **Pre-trained models** in `models/` directory

### Scripts & Tools
- **`demo.py`** - Complete end-to-end demonstration
- **`test_bsc_interaction.py`** - BSC Testnet integration tests
- **`simple_oracle_bridge.py`** - Simplified oracle operation
- **`direct_oracle_fulfillment.py`** - Direct oracle fulfillment
- **`event_monitor.py`** - Real-time event monitoring
- **`decode_events.py`** - Event decoding utilities

### Configuration & Setup
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - **📖 START HERE!** Complete setup instructions
- **`BLOCKCHAIN_SETUP.md`** - Blockchain-specific setup details
- **`config.json`** - Project configuration
- **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`package.json`** - Node.js dependencies
- **`truffle-config.js`** - Truffle configuration

### Tests & Migrations
- **`test/`** - Smart contract tests
- **`migrations/`** - Deployment scripts
- **`build/`** - Compiled contract artifacts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **READ THE SETUP GUIDE FIRST!**
Open `SETUP_GUIDE.md` and follow the step-by-step instructions. This is your complete guide to setting up the entire system.

### 2. Security Setup
```bash
# Create your .env file from the template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and RPC settings
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Node.js dependencies  
npm install
```

### 4. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to BSC Testnet
truffle migrate --network bscTestnet
```

### 5. Run Demo
```bash
# Run the complete end-to-end demo
python demo.py
```

## 🌟 System Overview

### How It Works
1. **Request**: User calls `requestPrediction()` on AIContract with input data
2. **Event**: Contract emits `PredictionRequested` event
3. **Oracle**: Python oracle bridge detects event and runs AI inference
4. **Fulfillment**: Oracle calls `fulfillPrediction()` with AI results
5. **Storage**: Prediction result is stored on-chain and event emitted

### Key Features
- ✅ **AI Model Integration** - TensorFlow/Keras model inference
- ✅ **Blockchain Oracle** - Secure off-chain to on-chain data bridge
- ✅ **Event Monitoring** - Real-time blockchain event detection
- ✅ **BSC Testnet Ready** - Pre-configured for Binance Smart Chain
- ✅ **Gas Optimized** - Efficient smart contract design
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management
- ✅ **Access Control** - Secure oracle authorization

## 📊 Tested & Verified

This system has been fully tested with:
- ✅ Contract deployment on BSC Testnet
- ✅ End-to-end prediction workflow
- ✅ Multiple successful oracle fulfillments
- ✅ Event emission and decoding
- ✅ Gas cost optimization
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supported Networks
- **BSC Testnet** (default, recommended for testing)
- **Local Ganache** (for development)
- **Polygon Mumbai** (alternative testnet)

### Environment Variables
Configure in `.env` file:
```bash
ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
CHAIN_ID=97
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. **First**: Read `SETUP_GUIDE.md` thoroughly
2. **Issues**: Check the troubleshooting section in SETUP_GUIDE.md
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all requirements are installed correctly
4. **Network**: Verify BSC Testnet connectivity and account funding

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Private keys are **NOT** included in this package
- ✅ Use `.env.example` to create your own `.env` file
- ✅ Never commit private keys to version control
- ✅ Use testnet tokens for testing (no real value)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After setup, you should be able to:
- ✅ Deploy contracts to BSC Testnet
- ✅ Run `python demo.py` successfully
- ✅ See prediction requests and fulfillments on blockchain
- ✅ Monitor events in real-time
- ✅ Get AI predictions stored on-chain
